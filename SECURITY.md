## Security Headers

Our application implements the following security headers:

```php
// Security Headers Configuration
return [
    'X-Frame-Options' => 'SAMEORIGIN',
    'X-Content-Type-Options' => 'nosniff',
    'X-XSS-Protection' => '1; mode=block',
    'Referrer-Policy' => 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
    'Content-Security-Policy' => "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';",
    'Permissions-Policy' => 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()',
];
```

## API Security

### Rate Limiting:
- **Auth endpoints**: 20 requests/minute
- **Public endpoints**: 60 requests/minute
- **Authenticated endpoints**: 120 requests/minute
- **Provider endpoints**: 300 requests/minute
- **Admin endpoints**: 600 requests/minute

### Input Validation:
- All API inputs are validated using Laravel's validation system
- Custom validation rules for business logic
- Sanitization of user inputs
- Type checking and conversion

### Error Handling:
- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Proper logging of security events
- No sensitive data in error responses

## Database Security

### Best Practices:
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Database user with minimal required privileges
- Regular database backups
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest

### Access Control:
- Role-based database access
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Connection encryption (SSL/TLS)

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Monitoring:
- Failed login attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- File upload monitoring
- Database query monitoring

### Logging:
